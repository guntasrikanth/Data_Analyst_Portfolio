## üìä Project Overview
This **Power** BI-driven **Hospitality Insights Dashboard** is designed to provide comprehensive analytics for the hospitality industry. It enables stakeholders to track key performance metrics such as **revenue trends, occupancy rates, and booking platform efficiency,** offering valuable insights to support strategic decision-making. By visualizing data in an intuitive and interactive format, the dashboard helps businesses optimize operations, enhance profitability, and respond proactively to market dynamics. Its user-friendly interface ensures seamless exploration of hospitality metrics for data-driven growth.

## üéØProblem statement

AtliQ Grands owns multiple five-star hotels across India. They have been in the hospitality industry for the past 20 years. Due to strategic moves from other competitors and ineffective decision-making in management, AtliQ Grands are losing its market share and revenue in the luxury/business hotels category. As a strategic move, the managing director of AtliQ Grands wanted to incorporate ‚ÄúBusiness and Data Intelligence‚Äù to regain their market share and revenue. However, they do not have an in-house data analytics team to provide them with these insights.

Their revenue management team had decided to hire a third-party service provider to provide insights from their historical data.
