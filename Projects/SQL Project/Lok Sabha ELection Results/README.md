Aggregated data showing the performance of different parties in each state. For example, in Uttar Pradesh, the Samajwadi Party (SP) won 37 seats, BJP won 33, and INC won 6 seats.

#### Vote Share: 
The percentage of votes received by each party in different regions, providing insights into the voting patterns and preferences of the electorate.
